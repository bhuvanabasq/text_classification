        "\n",
        "From these examples, we can see how the bag-of-words TFIDF method can retrieve entirely incorrect/irrevelant matches (Examples 1,4) whereas SBERT can always identify related job-titles even if better alternatives exist. For optimal performace, we can consider combining bag-of-words lexical matching with semantic similarity measures such as SBERT. As this is essentially an information-retrieval task, we can first use job-title as a query and use BM25 to retrieve some top N(say, 10) relevant jobs from ONET and then use SBERT for reranking these search results: this is inspired by [1].\n",
